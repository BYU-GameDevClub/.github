The purpose of the Game Development club is to connect people of all interest and experience levels who share a passion for game development.  Whether you're a seasoned programmer, a story writer, an animator, or something else entirely, if you think making a game sounds fun, the game development club has a place for you.  We will discuss techniques of game design, practice developing together, and build important networking for developers in all skillsets.
